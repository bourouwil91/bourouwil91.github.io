        THE OTHER WORLDLY AURORA borealis, or northern lights, begin high in the earth's atmosphere&#151;
        at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles&#151; when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic
        field. The <br>result is a colorful, dancing light show.<br><br>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antartica. 
        The are much more accessible places if you'd liked to take in these ligts shows yoursef. For the best seats to this celestical scene, consider anywhere
        with a magnetic latitude above 55&deg; and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitudeon NOAA and her. <br><br>
        In the polar latitudes, aurora can appear on any dark night. Long winter lights are good but not necessaroly the best time. Near equinoxes in March
        and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the <br>
        atmosphere, creating aurora seasons. I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperature in polar latitudes. Find
        the dark hours or your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
